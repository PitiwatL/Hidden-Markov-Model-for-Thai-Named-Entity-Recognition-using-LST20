# Hidden-Markov-Model-for-Thai-Named-Entity-Recognition-using-LST20

This project is one of my Hackathon competitions, and it's still is the developing process. 
The LST20 using in this code is copyright. However, the LST20 is available to download after registration here https://aiforthai.in.th/.
Also, more datail, and more understanable version will be update later. Based on the testing data, using uncleand training data and feeding to the model with 3 
consecutive hidden states, yields 
| Name-Entity-Recognition in LST20 | HMM (Uncleaned)|
| ------------- | ------------- |
|     85.53% | HMM (Uncleaned)  |
                              
Lastly, to develop this project further, we plan to improve this code for the GPU acceleration.
